This repository will be used to train AI and machine learning model

Step by step guide for text-to-image model refinement
1. Get labelled data with image and caption
2. Get models and weights for a specific model
3. Generate a few images as reference point
4. Train model and generate new weights
5. Generate a few images as reference points for comparision
6. Upload the model to huggingface if training produces good results

To RUN:
source setup_env.sh
